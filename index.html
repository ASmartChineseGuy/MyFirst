      <h2>The habit loop:Cue-Craving-Response-Reward</h2>
      <h2>FOUR LAWS TO GUIDE US</h2>
      <h3>LAW1: Make it obvious</h3>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Habit Scorecard</b> You must be aware of your habits
        before you can change them.You can write down all your daily behaviors
        on a habits scorecard.Until you make the unconscious conscious, it will
        direct your life and you will call it fate. Using the formula."I will
        [behavior] at [time] in [the location]."
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Stacking Habits</b> tie the desired habits with an
        existing habits. Using "After [current habit], i will [new habit]."
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Environment VS Motivation</b> We are more influenced by
        our environment than our willpower or motivation. Environment is the
        invisible hand that shapes human behavior.
      </p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Breaking a bad habit: Make it invisible.</b></p>
      <h3>LAW2: Make it attractive</h3>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Dopamine</b>The craving is what causes us to take action
        in the first place.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;<b>How to use tempetation bundling</b> Premack`s principle:
        "More probable behaviors reinforce less probable behaviors
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Group influence</b> Find groups to join where the habit
        you desire is the norm.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Where cravings come from</b> Huma`s underlying
        motives:obtaining food and water, conserving energy, finding love and
        reproducing, connecting and bonding with others, winning social
        acceptance and approval, reducing uncertainty , achieving status and
        prestige. Online platforms and products do not invent new motivations,
        but rather appeal to the underlying motives of human nature. Your habits
        are modern-day solutions to ancient desires,new versions of old vices.
        The underlying motives behind human nature remain the same.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;<b>How to reprogram your brain to enjoy hard habits</b> You
        can make hard habits more attractive if you can learn to associate them
        with a positive experience. By highlighting the benefits of a habit
        rather than its downsides,you can quickly reprogram your mind and make
        it seem more appealing.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Breaking a bad habit: Make it unattractive</b> To break a
        bad habit, do the same but highlight the benefits of <b>NOT</b> doing
        that habit.
      </p>
      <h3>LAW3: Make it easy</h3>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;<b>How long does it actually take to form a new habit</b>
        Long before the neuroscientists dug into the process of forming
        habits,repetition was known as a powerful tool for establishing habits.
        You activate particular neuro circuits associated with habits every time
        you repeat them. So framing habit formation in terms of time is flawed.
        It should be framed in terms of the number of repetition.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Reducing friction: the law of least effort</b> By making
        your good habits more convenient, you`re more likely to stick with them.
        In order to build better habits, we have to find ways to decrease
        friction associated with good habits and increase friction associated
        with bad habits.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Prime the environment for use</b> By automating or
        setting up your environment, you can reduce the friction for future
        action.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The 2-minute rule(stop procrastinating)</b> Using the
        "2-minute rule" can help you establish small habits that will lead to
        success in bigger ones. Find a simple 2-minute version of your desired
        habit. You want to scale down your desired outcome. You need to get the
        routine anchored in place and then slowly build up the difficulty. After
        you have mastered the 2-minute habit, you can progress to the next
        phase.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Breaking a bad habit: make it difficult</b> Think about
        ways you can put barriers of friction between youself and the bad habit.
        Make it as impractical as possible.
      </p>
      <h3>LAW4: Make it satisfying</h3>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The most important rule</b> A feeling of pleasure is a
        message to the brain:"This feels good. Let`s repeat this next time."
        When you experiences pleasure, your brain learns that a behavior is
        worth remembering and repeating. "What is immediately rewarded is
        repeated, what is immediately punished is avoided." The first three laws
        increases your chances of doing the habit this time. The last law
        increases your chances of repeating the habit next time.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;<b>The mismatch between immediate and delayed returns</b>
        Ignoring an immediate reward for a long-term one. It is best to add a
        little immediate pleasure to the habits that will pay off in the long
        run and a little pain to those that won`t.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Rewarding yourself and feeling successful</b> The vital
        thing in getting a habit to stick is to feel successful——even if it`s in
        small ways. The feeling of success is the signal that your habit paid
        off and that the work was worth the effort. It is satisfying to make
        progress, and you can monitor your progress using visual measures. These
        "little wins" can go a long ways. Keeping a habit tracker may be the
        best method to monitor your progress.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Habit tracking</b> Using a habit tracker is simple way to
        determine whether you did a particular habit. Tracking becomes a reward.
      </p>
      <p>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;<b>When life gets in the way (bad days)</b> In spite of your
        best efforts, it is inevitable that life will interrupt you at some
        point. When you`re having a bad day, you don`t realize how valuable it
        is to just show up. "Lost days hurt you more than successful days help
        you." Don`t break the chain of continuity. Missing twice is the start of
        a bad habit; never do it.
